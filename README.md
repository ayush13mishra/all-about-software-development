# all-about-software-development

<pre>
My work experience tells below are important:

# logging level

1. dev,qa,prod environment

  important log messages at error level

2. local environment (computer/laptop)

  log messages at verbose level
  
3. log levels must be externally controllable

  form environment variables, host.json file, etc.
  restart application is generally done when doing above as a best practice


# time stamps

  all important operations, must be having TIME TAKEN logs, which tell how much time they took - save time for customer and cost
